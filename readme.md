# This is a simple implementation and visualization of boids.

# Boids are objects that exhibit swarm behavior by individually moving according
# to 3 rules:

# 1) alignment
# 2) separation
# 3) cohesion

# An additional rule ensures that they stay within the boundaries of the window.

# To run, execute main.py and adjust boid behavior by setting the according flags

# Further information can be obtained with main.py --help
